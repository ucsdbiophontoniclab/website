metaDescription: Our new lab logo for poster and presentation
---

We finally got a lab logo and icon for putting on your poster presentation
or presentation. I put the SVG file in `static/assets/logos` for the
lab members who intend to use the logos for their presentation.

Our logo represents biomedical research and data research that we do at the lab.
It also draws inspiration from binary bits. The curve in the logo representing movement
and vibrant lab culture that I would like to push for.

Below are our logos with the our lab name using [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand)
font (meduim for the lab name and light for the university name).
