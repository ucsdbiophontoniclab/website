We decide to have a first knowledge sharing sessions at the lab.
Our first knowledge sharing sessions will begin in the Fall semester, 2022.
The session is as follow:

| Date       | Time          | Topic                                                    | Speaker      |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |

| 17/08/2022 | 16:00 - 17:30 | Fourier & Wavelet transforms                             | Earth, Tong  |
| 31/08/2022 | 16:00 - 17:30 | Representation learning, Self-supervised learning        | Earth, Tong  |

For those who has little experience in deep learning, I encourage to go through the basic concepts of deep learning
first. This includes programming in Pytorch, basic terminologies (batch size, epoch, model architecture,
gradient descent, optimizers, learning rate, scheduler). You can always consult
[Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning course](https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html) if you want
to cover some basic concepts in deep learning with code.

Some topics are related to signal processing.
Some of the concepts are well described in [Steve Brunton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7KLbd7n75g)
and [Nathan Kutz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViZYXxuxUKA) lectures. If you are interested in signal processing,
feel free to watch more videos there.

I am looking forward to learn together with all the lab members in this coming semester.
