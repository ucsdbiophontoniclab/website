Titipat Achakulvisut runs the biomedical and data lab (BioDat lab) at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. He completed his Ph.D. in Bioengineering at University of Pennsylvania with Konrad Kording working on applying natural language processing and machine learning to improve scientific processes. His interests are to combine NLP, ML, and tools to improve science itself. In extension to his core research, he also broadly interests in applying ML and NLP in biomedical and business domains in Thailand where he collaborate with multiple research groups and companies in Thailand pushing NLP and ML for real use cases.
