Peeranat Buabang "Yok" is a first year undergraduate student at the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Mahidol University.

His field of interests are machine learning and video game development. Currently, he is working on object detection which is part of detecting the behavior of monkeys from videos with Vittawat. He never thought that he could be an engineer. He started from his interests, and he wants to make it happen. Coding is the thing that he loves to study even though he has to spend a lot of time to understand it. However, he hopes in one day, he will use his skill to make it come true :)
