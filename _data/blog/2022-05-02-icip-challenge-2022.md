Parasitic infections are one of the leading causes of death and other ailments worldwide. Detecting such infections using traditional
diagnostic procedures requires experienced medical technologists together with a significant amount of time and effort.
An automated procedure with the ability to accurately detect parasitic diseases can accelerate the process greatly.
Hence, in this work, we propose a deep learning-based parasitic egg detection pipeline. We trained deep learning models using parasitic
egg detection and classification datasets provided by [ICIP Grand Challenge 2022](https://icip2022challenge.piclab.ai/).

Our solution got rank 3 at the competition happening at IEEE ICIP Conference in Bordeaux, France in October 2022.
We got an mIoU score of 92.946 and mF1Score of 98.633. If you are interested in our solution, please check out our
[paper on IEEE Explore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9897464) and [our code on Github](https://github.com/biodatlab/icip-challenge-2022).
